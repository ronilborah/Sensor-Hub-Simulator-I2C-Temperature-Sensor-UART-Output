My Contribution — Sensor Hub Simulator

Author: (Fill with your name) — initial draft by GitHub Copilot (assistant)

Summary of work performed:
- Explored repository and verified Verilog modules and testbenches present in the workspace.
- Documented module responsibilities and created run instructions for both Icarus and Vivado.
- Added guidance for waveform capture and how to produce the expected UART output "Temp = 25".
- Created templates and instruction files to collect teammate contributions and media assets.

Files reviewed / relevant modules:
- `i2c_slave_dummy.v` — verified it models a fixed temperature response (25 decimal).
- `ascii_encoder.v`, `ascii_uart_sender.v`, `buildstring.v` — responsible for turning read temperature into printable ASCII and sending via UART.
- `uart_tx.v` — UART transmit FSM and shift logic.
- Testbenches: `tb_ascii_uart_sender.v`, `tb_i2c_slave_dummy.v`, `uart_tx_tb.v` used for simulation validation.

Tests run locally (recommended):
1) Icarus simulation: compile top-level testbench and run VVP; view VCD in GTKWave.
2) Vivado behavioral simulation: run and capture waveform in Vivado's simulator.

Changes made:
- Added documentation files to the `docs/` folder describing modules, run steps, recording instructions, and a README.

Limitations / TODOs:
- I did not modify or add Verilog source code; changes are documentation-only.
- I could not produce a Vivado bitstream or a screen-recorded video here — please follow `docs/media_instructions.txt` to generate and place `docs/media/vivado_run.mp4`.

Next steps (recommended):
- Team members should fill their individual contribution documents and attach waveforms or videos under `docs/media/`.
- Optionally add a `Makefile` with `make sim` and `make vivado` targets to standardize builds.

Resources used while preparing this document:
- Provided playlist and links in README and resources file.
