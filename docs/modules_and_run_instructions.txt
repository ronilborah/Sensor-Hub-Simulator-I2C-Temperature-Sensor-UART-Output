Module & Run Instructions for Sensor Hub Simulator

Repository files (key Verilog sources):
- ascii_encoder.v: converts binary values to ASCII characters for UART transmission.
- ascii_uart_sender.v: high-level ASCII string sender that sequences ASCII bytes to UART TX.
- buildstring.v: helpers for building ASCII strings from numeric values.
- i2c_slave_dummy.v: a simple I2C slave that responds with a fixed temperature (25).
- tb_i2c_slave_dummy.v: testbench for the I2C dummy slave.
- tb_ascii_uart_sender.v: testbench for ascii_uart_sender flow (I2C -> ASCII -> UART).
- uart_tx.v: UART transmit core (baud generator, FSM, shift register).
- uart_tx_tb.v: UART transmitter testbench.

Simulation using Icarus Verilog (fast, suitable for CI/local testing):
1) Install tools:
   - macOS: `brew install icarus-verilog gtkwave`

2) Example: compile and run the UART transmitter testbench
   - `iverilog -o uart_tb.vvp uart_tx.v uart_tx_tb.v`
   - `vvp uart_tb.vvp`
   - View waveform (if generated as VCD): `gtkwave uart_tx.vcd`

3) Example: full test (ascii sender + I2C dummy + UART)
   - `iverilog -o full_tb.vvp ascii_encoder.v ascii_uart_sender.v buildstring.v i2c_slave_dummy.v tb_ascii_uart_sender.v uart_tx.v`
   - `vvp full_tb.vvp`
   - Open waveforms with `gtkwave` on the produced VCD file (look for `sim.out` or `*.vcd`).

Notes for simulation:
- Ensure the top-level testbench generates a clock and reset signals and writes a VCD or `.vpd` file.
- If a testbench expects specific file names, open the testbench to confirm generated VCD file name.

Running in Xilinx Vivado (for hardware build and waveform capture):
1) Create a new RTL project in Vivado, add the Verilog sources above and the appropriate testbench if using Vivado Simulator.
2) Ensure target device includes Zynq / board models if you intend to synthesize and implement. For simulation only, device selection is not critical.
3) To run behavioral simulation in Vivado:
   - Flow: Flow Navigator -> Simulation -> Run Simulation -> Run Behavioral Simulation
   - Use the Vivado waveform viewer to inspect `SCL`, `SDA`, `tx`, and other signals.
4) To synthesize/implement for a board (optional):
   - Add constraints (XDC) mapping `SCL`, `SDA`, `tx` to physical pins on your board.
   - Run Synthesis -> Implementation -> Generate Bitstream.
   - Program the device via Hardware Manager.

Recording Vivado waveform/video:
- See `docs/media_instructions.txt` for recommended screen recording settings and steps to capture the simulation/waveform window.

Expected outputs:
- UART TX should output ASCII bytes corresponding to the read temperature: e.g., "Temp = 25".
- I2C SCL and SDA should show START, address, ACK, data (0x19 for 25 decimal), STOP sequence.

Known notes and troubleshooting:
- If UART bits look inverted or bit ordering is wrong, verify that `uart_tx.v` shifts LSB first and that the baud tick generator matches the testbench clock.
- For I2C mismatches, check SDA tri-state handling in `i2c_slave_dummy.v` and ensure pull-ups are modeled or present in hardware.

If you want, I can add example `Makefile` targets for the above commands.
