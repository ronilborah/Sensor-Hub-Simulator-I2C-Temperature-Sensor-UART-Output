Teammate Contribution Template — Sensor Hub Simulator

Please copy this file into `docs/<your_name>_contribution.txt` and fill each section with as much technical detail as possible.

1) Author
- Name:
- Role / Responsibilities:

2) Summary of Work
- Short description (1-2 lines):

3) Files edited / created
- List each file you changed and provide a short rationale for the change.
  - Example: `uart_tx.v` — fixed off-by-one in bit counter; verified with `uart_tx_tb.v`.

4) Detailed technical notes (required)
- Describe algorithms, FSM states, timing considerations, and any tradeoffs.
- For I2C: explain START/STOP timing, ACK sampling strategy, SDA tri-state handling.
- For UART: explain baud generation, tick alignment, LSB/MSB order, framing bits.
- For ASCII conversion: describe number-to-string approach, fixed-width vs variable length.

5) Tests performed
- Exact commands to run (iverilog, vvp, gtkwave, or Vivado simulation steps).
- Expected waveform highlights (which signals to inspect and what values they should have).

6) Issues encountered and unresolved items
- Be explicit: provide file names and line ranges where relevant and describe debugging steps taken.

7) Media / Artifacts
- Attach waveform screenshots (place under `docs/media/`) and reference file names here.
- If you recorded a video, name it `docs/media/<yourname>_vivado_run.mp4` and provide a brief description.

8) References and resources
- List links to tutorials, datasheets, or videos you used (include timestamps when helpful).

9) Time log (optional)
- Dates and approximate hours spent on each subtask.

Thank you — once filled, notify the repo maintainer so they can aggregate and review the contributions.
