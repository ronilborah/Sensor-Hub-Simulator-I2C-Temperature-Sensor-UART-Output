Media & Vivado Recording Instructions

Objective: record a short video showing Vivado simulation or implementation flow, capture waveform showing I2C and UART activity, and save the recording to the repo under `docs/media/`.

Recommended tools (macOS):
- Built-in Screen Recording: QuickTime Player -> File -> New Screen Recording
- Alternatively: OBS Studio (free) for higher control and MP4 recording.

Recording steps (Vivado behavioral simulation):
1) Open Vivado and load the project (or create a new project and add sources from the repo).
2) Run Behavioral Simulation: Flow Navigator -> Simulation -> Run Behavioral Simulation.
3) In the Waveform viewer, expand signals: `SCL`, `SDA`, `tx`, `clk`, `reset`.
4) Optionally add cursors and zoom to the regions showing START/address/data/STOP or UART frame for a selected byte.
5) Start screen recording (QuickTime or OBS) and capture the Vivado window and waveform pane.
6) Perform simulation run (hit the run button) to generate the waveform while recording.
7) Stop recording when you have captured the required waveforms.

File naming and placement:
- Name the video `<yourname>_vivado_run.mp4` and place it in `docs/media/`.
- Also include 1-3 PNG screenshots showing zoomed-in waveforms named `<yourname>_wave_1.png`, etc.

Recording settings suggestions:
- Resolution: 1920x1080 (or your screen native if higher)
- Frame rate: 30 fps
- Output format: MP4 (H.264)
- Audio: off / mute (narration not required)

If you cannot record, instead place waveform images and a short text description in `docs/media/README.txt` describing the steps taken to reproduce the waveform.
