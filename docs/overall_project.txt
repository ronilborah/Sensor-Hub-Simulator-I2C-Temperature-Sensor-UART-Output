Overall Project — Sensor Hub Simulator (I2C Temperature Sensor + UART Output)

Project objective:
To simulate an FPGA-based sensor hub that reads temperature data from an I2C temperature sensor (dummy slave) and forwards human-readable temperature via UART to a PC terminal.

High-level architecture:
- I2C Master (FPGA logic): issues START, address + R/W, reads one data byte, issues STOP.
- I2C Dummy Slave: responds with fixed temperature value (25 decimal / 0x19 hex).
- ASCII Builder: converts numeric temperature into ASCII characters (e.g., "Temp = 25\n").
- UART Transmitter: serializes ASCII bytes at configured baud rate and sends over `tx` line.

Module interactions and data flow:
1) At power-up or on request, the I2C master initiates a read to the temperature slave address.
2) The slave ACKs the address and returns the temperature byte.
3) The ASCII builder composes the output string and forwards bytes to the UART transmitter.
4) The UART TX FSM transmits framed bytes with start and stop bits to the PC serial adapter.

Test strategy:
- Unit test I2C slave behavior using `tb_i2c_slave_dummy.v`.
- Unit test UART TX using `uart_tx_tb.v`.
- End-to-end test via `tb_ascii_uart_sender.v` to validate whole chain.

Acceptance criteria:
- Correct I2C START/STOP sequence and ACK sampling.
- Read data equals 25 (0x19) from dummy slave.
- UART output contains ASCII "Temp = 25" with proper framing.

Known limitations:
- The I2C dummy is a simplified model and does not implement advanced features like clock stretching, multi-register addressing or multi-byte transfers.
- No formal timing closure or synthesis constraints are included for specific FPGA boards in this repository.

Proposed improvements:
- Add `Makefile` with standard `make sim` and `make waveform` targets.
- Add a CI job to run iverilog tests and produce waveforms for PRs.
- Expand I2C dummy to a multi-register model with configurable temp values.
